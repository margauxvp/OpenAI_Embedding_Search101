                "header": "Paris to charge SUV drivers higher parking fees to tackle ‘auto-besity’",
                "body": "Paris city hall is to impose higher parking fees on owners of SUVs in its battle to reduce pollution in the capital.\n\nDetails of the charges have not been announced but the size, weight of the vehicle and its motor will be taken into consideration.\n\nElectric vehicles and those with large families requiring a bigger car are expected to escape the increased fees that will come into effect on 1 January 2024.\n\nParis councillors approved the measure in an unanimous vote last month. Frédéric Badina-Serpette, a councillor from the EELV ecology party that proposed the increased charges, said: “We would like the city of Paris to change the pricing of paid parking to make it progressive according to the weight and size of vehicles.”\n\nHe said the aim was “to focus on an absurdity: auto-besity … the inexorable growth in the weight and size of vehicles circulating in our cities, and particularly in Paris”.\n\nOfficials say the number of SUVs in the city has increased by 60% over the last four years and they now make up 15% of the 1.15m private vehicles parked in Paris every evening. They hope raising fees will put a brake on the increase and encourage the ownership of lighter vehicles.\n\n“From 1 January 2024, SUV owners can expect to pay higher fees to park in the French capital,” the council said in a statement.\n\nDavid Belliard, a deputy mayor responsible for public space and mobility policy, said SUVs were incongruous in an urban environment.\n\n“There are no dirt paths, no mountain roads … SUVs are absolutely useless in Paris. Worse, they are dangerous, cumbersome and use too many resources to manufacture,” Belliard said.\n\nHowever, Pierre Chasseray, a spokesperson for the driver defence group 40 millions d’Automobilistes, said the number of SUVs had risen because larger families were buying them to replace their people carriers.\n\n“They are family vehicles … used for going away at weekends or on holiday. We’re pandering to a tiny minority of the very urban population who have decided to make the SUV the symbol of the battle against pollution,” Chasseray told Le Parisien.\n\nIn Lyon, the authorities have also announced higher parking charges based on vehicle weight from next year. Grenoble is expected to introduce a similar scheme."

                "header": "Trump asks for classified documents trial to take place after 2024 election",
                "body": "Donald Trump asked the federal judge overseeing the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case to indefinitely postpone setting a trial date in court filings on Monday and suggested, at a minimum, that any scheduled trial should not take place until after the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe papers submitted by Trump’s lawyers in response to the US justice department’s motion to hold the trial this December made clear the former president’s aim to delay proceedings as their guiding strategy – the case may be dropped if Trump wins the election.\n\nTrump’s lawyers essentially argued in the 12-page court filing to US district court judge Aileen Cannon in Florida that she should not bother setting a tentative trial date until the major pre-trial motions were finished because they could not know how long the discovery process might take.\n\n“The court should, respectfully, before establishing any trial date, allow time for development of further clarity as to the full nature and scope of the motions that will be filed,” the filing said.\n\nTrump was charged with retention of national defense information, including US nuclear secrets and plans for US retaliation in the event of an attack, which means his case will be tried under the rules laid out in the Classified Information Procedures Act, or Cipa.\n\nCipa provides a mechanism for the government to charge cases involving classified documents without risking the “graymail” problem, where the defense threatens to reveal classified information at trial, but the steps that have to be followed mean it takes longer to get to trial.\n\nThe process includes the government turning over all of the classified information they want to use to the defense in discovery, like any other criminal case, in addition to the non-classified discovery that is done in a separate process.\n\nTrump’s lawyers argued the amount of discovery – the government is making the material available in batches because there is so much evidence and it has not finished processing everything that came from search warrants – meant that they could not know how long the process would take.\n\n“From a practical manner, the volume of discovery and the Cipa logistics alone make plain that the government’s requested schedule is unrealistic,” Trump’s lawyers wrote.\n\nThe filing also complained that the justice department’s proposed December trial date did not reflect precedent, such as with former NSA analyst Reality Winner, who was charged with retaining national defense information in June 2017 and only went to trial in October 2018."

                "header": "Tom Holland: ‘I felt enslaved to alcohol’",
                "body": "Tom Holland, the British actor best known for playing Spider-Man, has opened up about his battles with sobriety. Speaking to the On Purpose with Jay Shetty podcast, the actor, 27, said that quitting alcohol was “the best thing I’ve ever done” after he’d been “scared” by realizing the extent of his dependence.\n\nAfter a “very, very boozy” Christmas period in 2022, Holland found that having resolved to complete a dry January, “all I could think about was having a drink … It really scared me”.\n\n“I just was like, ‘Wow, maybe I have a little bit of an alcohol thing.’”\n\nHolland resolved to extend his period of sobriety, but found it hard to do so in England, where he said he found socializing and alcohol were significantly intertwined.\n\n“I felt like I couldn’t be social,” said Holland. “I felt like I couldn’t go to the pub and have a lime soda. I couldn’t go out for dinner. I was really, really struggling.”\n\nIn particular, he added, he found he needed to distance himself from friends in the rugby community, “because so much of it is about how much can you drink”.\n\n“I just sort of said to myself, like, ‘Why? Why am I enslaved to this drink? Why am I so obsessed by the idea of having this drink?’”\n\nBy the actor’s 27th birthday on 1 June, he had gone for six months without drinking and said he was “the happiest I’ve ever been in my life”. He found benefits included improved sleep and ability to handle everyday obstacles.\n\n“Things that would go wrong on set, that would normally set me off, I could take in my stride. I had such better mental clarity. I felt healthier, I felt fitter.\n\n“I’m happy to say it – I was definitely addicted to alcohol. I’m not shying away from that at all.”\n\nHolland has said his journey inspired his mother to follow suit, with positive consequences.\n\n“She’s loving it, and it’s been amazing,” he said. “I can’t believe the difference that I feel from not drinking. Yeah, I feel amazing.”\n\nHolland is currently on a break from acting, after a grueling shoot on Apple TV series The Crowded Room, in which he played an American criminal with dissociative identity disorder.\n\nHolland’s career started to take off when he played Billy Elliot in the West End, before making his big-screen breakthrough with 2012’s tsunami drama The Impossible.\n\nHe made his debut as Spider-Man in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War, and has since starred in three standalone Spider-Man movies. The most recent of these, No Way Home, was the highest-grossing film of 2021."

                "body": "All six people onboard a tourist helicopter in Nepal have been killed after it crashed soon after takeoff in the Everest region.\n\nThe Manang Air flight was heading for the capital, Kathmandu, from near Lukla, a gateway for climbing expeditions to the world’s highest peak, with five Mexican tourists – two men and three women – and a Nepali pilot onboard.\n\nThe helicopter lost contact eight minutes after taking off on Tuesday morning, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) said in a statement.\n\n“The six bodies have been recovered and brought to Kathmandu,” Pratap Babu Tiwari, the general manager at the Tribhuvan international airport, told AFP.\n\nTwo helicopters were deployed for search and rescue but could not land at the crash site because of the weather. “The teams on the ground brought the bodies to the helicopters which were able to land close by,” Tiwari said.\n\nLhakpa Sherpa, a resident who joined search and rescue efforts, described the scene as “very scary”. “It looks like the helicopter first collided with a tree and then slammed on the floor. It has caused a small hole in the ground,” he said.\n\nNepal’s prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, expressed grief over the incident, his office said on Twitter.\n\nNepal has a booming private helicopter industry, flying tourists and goods to remote corners of the Himalayan nation where road access is limited. The country is notorious for its poor air safety, and Tuesday’s incident is the latest in a string of aviation crashes.\n\nOne person was killed and four were injured in May when a helicopter crashed in eastern Nepal after dropping off goods for a hydroelectricity project.\n\nMultiple helicopter accidents claimed more than a dozen lives during rescue and relief operations in the aftermath of Nepal’s devastating 2015 earthquake.\n\nPlane crashes are also common in the Himalayan republic, home to remote and tricky runways flanked by snow-capped peaks that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots. The weather can change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions, and Nepal’s poor safety record has been exacerbated by insufficient training and maintenance.\n\nAll 72 people onboard a flight to the tourist city of Pokhara were killed in January when the plane plummeted into a steep gorge.\n\nIn 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines plane crash-landed near Kathmandu’s international airport, killing 51 people and seriously injuring 20.\n\nIn 1992, in Nepal’s deadliest air accident, all 167 people onboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport.\n\nThe EU has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns."
